    # When the key file specified here is used, you will be prompted for
    # its passphrase. At that time, the filename will appear with input
    # prompt. If the filename is specified as an absolute path, the home
    # directory path and the user name will be visible to the outside
    # world. It is possible to specify the filename using relative path.
    # By setting the line below, only 'ssh/identity' will be displayed
    # as the filename, preventing the home directory path and the user
    # name from being exposed to the outside world. Note: In this case,
    # the filename must be relative to the directory from which ssh was
    # invoked.
